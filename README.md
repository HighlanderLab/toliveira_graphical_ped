# Pedigree based mixed-effects models using directed acyclic graphs

This repository presents an evaluation of different MCMC samplers and parameterizations for the animal model, a statistical model commonly used in animal breeding. The focus is on the efficiency and accuracy of the different implementations, with comparisons made between JAGS and NIMBLE packages as well as various parameterizations of the model. The results show that the transformed additive genetic values approach consistently produces chains with a considerably larger effective sample size due to prior independence among additive genetic values. However, the Cholesky decomposition of the NRM using the Gibbs sampling algorithm is the most time-consuming approach, and the implementation with the transformed additive genetic values constantly produced chains with a considerably lower effective sample size when using Gibbs sampling sampler. Furthermore, NIMBLE was found to be more efficient than JAGS for running complex models. These findings have important implications for the choice of MCMC samplers and parameterizations when working with animal models in animal breeding.
